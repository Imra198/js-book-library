# JavaScript Book Library

A simple JavaScript project that demonstrates DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a list of books on a web page.

The project uses vanilla JavaScript to create and insert HTML elements once the DOM has fully loaded. Basic CSS styling is applied to improve layout and user experience.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Features
- Displays a list of book titles dynamically
- Uses `DOMContentLoaded` to ensure safe DOM access
- Demonstrates element creation and appending
- Clean and responsive layout with basic styling

## Project Structure
.
├── index.html
├── script.js
└── style.css

## How It Works
- The HTML provides the page structure and container
- JavaScript waits for the DOM to load, then loops through an array of book titles
- Each book is added to the page as a list item
- CSS styles the list for readability and visual clarity

## Purpose
This project was created as a learning exercise to practice JavaScript fundamentals, including arrays, loops, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## How to Run
Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
